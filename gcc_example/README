-Wall : Enables all the warning levels. Most of the time we need to check the warnings with at most care.
-Wextra: Few warning levels are not enabled with '-Wall', this adds those.

For sure 'man gcc' is the right place to check what is added under '-Wall' and '-Wextra'

-g3: Debug level 3. g is enough (by defaults to g2). At least for me, 'g3' is free of cost to show more for MACROS as well.

/*

 *
 * # Compiler stage
 * gcc -Wall -Wextra -g3 -S ./hello.c

 * gcc -Wall -Wextra -g3 -c ./hello.c

 * - Executable binary file in ELF format is generated
 * - To run this program simply run "./hello"
 * - Notice the file permission : set with executable bit on

- The size of binary file will be very huge when it is compiled with '-g3'. Strip the binary using 'strip' command and use '-O3' for gcc's power of optimization effect.
